### Step 1: Open Group Policy Management Console

1. Press `Windows + R` to open the Run dialog.
2. Type `gpmc.msc` and press `Enter` to open the Group Policy Management Console.

### Step 2: Create or Edit a Group Policy Object (GPO)

1. In the left pane, navigate to the organizational unit (OU) where you want to apply the policy.
2. Right-click the OU and select **Create a GPO in this domain, and Link it here** or select an existing GPO and click **Edit**.

### Step 3: Configure Remote Desktop Settings

1. In the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to:
   ```
   Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Windows Settings -> Security Settings -> Local Policies -> User Rights Assignment
   ```

2. Locate **Allow log on through Remote Desktop Services**.
   - Double-click it to open properties.
   - Click **Add User or Group**.
   - Enter the name of the user or group (e.g., `Remote Desktop Users`) that you want to grant access to.
   - Click **OK**.

### Step 4: Enable Remote Desktop on the Server

1. Still in the Group Policy Management Editor, navigate to:
   ```
   Computer Configuration -> Policies -> Administrative Templates -> Windows Components -> Remote Desktop Services -> Remote Desktop Session Host -> Connections
   ```

2. Locate **Allow users to connect remotely using Remote Desktop Services**.
   - Double-click it, set it to **Enabled**, and click **OK**.

### Step 5: Refresh Group Policy

1. To ensure the new settings take effect, you can run the following command on the server:
   ```bash
   gpupdate /force
   ```

### Step 6: Verify Remote Desktop Access

1. Ensure that the Remote Desktop feature is enabled on the server:
   - Right-click on **This PC** or **My Computer**, select **Properties**.
   - Click on **Remote settings** on the left.
   - In the Remote tab, make sure **Allow remote connections to this computer** is selected.

2. Ensure the firewall allows Remote Desktop connections:
   - Go to **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security**.
   - Under **Inbound Rules**, ensure that **Remote Desktop - User Mode (TCP-In)** is enabled.

### Conclusion

After completing these steps, members of the specified user group should be able to log in remotely to the Windows Server 2019 instance. Make sure to test the remote access to confirm everything is configured correctly.
