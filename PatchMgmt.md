### **Windows Patching with Intune**

Microsoft **Intune** is a cloud-based endpoint management service that is part of the **Microsoft Endpoint Manager** suite. It enables IT administrators to manage, configure, and enforce policies on Windows devices (as well as macOS, iOS, and Android). One of its key capabilities is patch management — specifically managing the deployment of Windows updates and patches.

In Intune, Windows patching involves using the **Windows Update for Business** feature, which allows you to configure update settings and deploy updates to your managed Windows 10/11 devices. Here's a comprehensive guide to managing Windows patching with Intune.

### **1. Windows Update for Business in Intune**

**Windows Update for Business** allows organizations to configure the update process by controlling things like update deferral, feature and quality updates, and update restart behavior. Intune uses this feature to manage when and how updates are delivered to Windows 10/11 devices.

#### **Key Concepts:**
- **Feature Updates**: Major updates that introduce new features and functionality.
- **Quality Updates**: Security and reliability fixes, typically released monthly (known as Patch Tuesday).
- **Windows Update Rings**: Groups of devices that receive updates based on your configuration.
- **Update Deferrals**: Settings to delay the installation of updates.

### **2. Configuring Windows Update for Business in Intune**

#### **Step 1: Create an Update Ring (Windows Update Ring)**

In Intune, you can create **Update Rings** for both **feature updates** and **quality updates**. These update rings determine when and how the updates are applied.

##### **Creating a Feature Update Ring:**

1. **Sign in to the Microsoft Endpoint Manager admin center**:  
   Go to [https://endpoint.microsoft.com](https://endpoint.microsoft.com).

2. **Navigate to Devices > Windows > Update Rings for Windows 10 and later**.

3. Click **+ Create profile**.

4. **Profile Type**: Select **Windows Update Ring**.

5. **Name the Profile**: Give the profile a meaningful name, such as "Feature Update Ring – First Wave".

6. **Configuration**:  
   - **Update Settings**: You can configure settings such as:
     - **Deployment Ring**: Choose whether the update applies to all users or just a selected group.
     - **Update Deferral**: Specify how long updates are deferred (e.g., 30 days).
     - **Quality and Feature Update Deployment**: Configure when the devices should get updates (e.g., immediately after release, or after a certain delay).

7. **Assignments**: Choose which groups of devices should receive the update.

8. **Review and Create**: Review your settings and create the profile.

##### **Creating a Quality Update Ring**:

The steps are similar to creating a feature update ring but specifically for **quality updates** (security and bug fixes).

1. Go to **Devices > Windows > Update Rings for Windows 10 and later**.
2. Click **+ Create profile** and select **Quality Update Ring**.
3. Configure settings like:
   - **Installation behavior**: Allow automatic installation or notify users to install.
   - **Update schedule**: Choose a time window for updates to be installed.
   - **Deferrals**: Delay quality updates for a defined period, such as 30 days or more.

4. Assign the policy to user/device groups and save the profile.

#### **Step 2: Configure Automatic Update Behavior**

You can configure automatic updates to ensure devices are always up to date with the latest patches.

1. **Go to**: **Devices > Windows > Update Rings for Windows 10 and later**.
2. **Choose the ring** you created.
3. **Automatic Updates Settings**:  
   - **Automatic Update Behavior**: Configure whether updates are automatically installed or whether the user is prompted to install updates.
   - **Restart Settings**: Configure restart options like **automatic restart after updates**, **grace periods**, and **active hours** to avoid restarts during business hours.
   - **Update Notification Settings**: You can choose whether to notify users when updates are available or force them to restart after updates.

#### **Step 3: Configure Windows Update Notifications**

You can configure **Windows Update Notifications** via Intune to alert users about the status of updates.

1. **Navigate to**: **Devices > Windows > Update Rings for Windows 10 and later**.
2. Configure notifications like:
   - **Restart notifications**: Let users know when updates require a restart.
   - **Update status notifications**: Inform users about the update status, whether it’s installing or pending.

### **3. Managing Windows Updates with Intune - Key Features**

#### **Update Deployment Options:**
- **Deployment Rings**: Allows you to roll out updates gradually, starting with a pilot group, then expanding to a broader set of devices.
- **Update Deferrals**: Deferring updates (both feature and quality updates) for a certain number of days allows you to test updates before they’re applied to all devices.
- **Ring Levels**: Different groups of devices can be assigned to different rings, allowing for more granular control over when updates are deployed.
  
#### **Compliance Policies for Updates:**
Intune also allows you to enforce **compliance policies** related to updates. You can configure policies to ensure that devices stay compliant with update requirements.

1. **Go to**: **Devices > Windows > Compliance policies**.
2. **Create a Compliance Policy** and choose the settings related to updates, such as:
   - **Minimum version**: Ensure devices are running a minimum version of Windows.
   - **Update Enforcement**: Ensure the latest security patches are installed.

This ensures that devices that fall out of compliance (due to not receiving important updates) can be flagged and corrected.

### **4. Windows Autopilot and Update Profiles (Optional)**

If you are using **Windows Autopilot** for provisioning new devices, you can configure update settings in **Autopilot profiles**. These profiles allow you to automatically configure device settings, including update policies, during the initial setup process.

- **Configure Autopilot profiles** to automatically assign devices to specific update rings based on factors such as device type, user role, or geographic location.

### **5. Monitoring and Reporting on Windows Update Status**

Intune provides various reporting options to track the status of updates and deployments.

1. **Go to**: **Devices > Windows > Update Rings for Windows 10 and later**.
2. **Monitor the Status** of your deployment, including:
   - **Update installation success/failure rates**.
   - **Pending updates**: Devices that have pending updates.
   - **Update compliance**: Devices that are up-to-date vs those that are not.

3. **Reporting on Update Deployment**:
   - Navigate to **Reports** in Intune for detailed insights on update compliance, feature update deployments, and more.
   - Use **Windows Update for Business** reports to track which devices have successfully installed updates and which ones are out of compliance.

### **6. Managing Windows Update with PowerShell Scripts in Intune**

If you require additional customization, Intune allows you to run PowerShell scripts on Windows devices. These scripts can be used to:
- Force updates
- Trigger restarts
- Check for pending updates
- Customize Windows Update settings beyond what is available in the Intune portal.

1. **Go to**: **Devices > Windows > PowerShell scripts**.
2. **Upload and Assign a PowerShell Script** that interacts with Windows Update using `Get-WindowsUpdate`, `Install-WindowsUpdate`, or other cmdlets from the `PSWindowsUpdate` module.

### **7. Best Practices for Windows Patching with Intune**

- **Start with a pilot group**: Deploy updates to a small group first to ensure there are no issues, then expand the deployment gradually.
- **Use multiple update rings**: Have a ring for **testing** and another for **production** environments.
- **Enforce update compliance**: Ensure that devices are compliant with the latest security patches through compliance policies.
- **Automate patching where possible**: Use automatic updates and automatic installation of quality updates to reduce manual intervention.
- **Monitor the update process**: Use Intune’s reporting tools to stay on top of update installations and identify any issues promptly.

### **Conclusion**

Windows patching in Intune allows you to efficiently manage and control how updates are delivered to your Windows 10 and 11 devices. By using **Windows Update for Business**, creating **update rings**, enforcing **compliance policies**, and automating updates, you can ensure that your devices stay secure and up-to-date with minimal manual effort.

In addition to using the Intune console, you can extend functionality by using **PowerShell scripts**, **Autopilot**, and **Windows Autopatch** (if available) to further optimize your update management strategy.
